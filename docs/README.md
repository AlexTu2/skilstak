# Welcome to SKILSTAK!

Welcome to the **SKILSTAK Learning Community**!

You've reached the SKILSTAK knowledge base and home of the annual, rotating, crowd-sourced, live-streamed [SKILSTAK Beginner Boost](boost) currently led by [rwxrob](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob). Here we document the skills, knowledge, and abilities needed to get and maintain an amazing career in tech. Master, beginner, or just lurker, we do hope you will join us as we blow the doors off of traditional education paradigms and focus on skills-based tech learning with substance.

!!! note "Pardon our plainness"

    Perhaps you have noticed how boring our web site is. It isn't flashy by design. In fact, you overly flashy things are usually [pretty sus](https://youtu.be/DMZd535WTkY). Our priority is on searchable, mobile-friendly, dynamic content that supplements YouTube videos, live Twitch sessions, Discord channel discussions, and—most of all—your own notes and labs. Like tech, this stuff is always changing so please adjust your expectations to match. If you see something wrong, please let us know.

!!! tip "Want to help write these docs?"
    Take note of the icons on each page that allow you to contribute content to the docs yourself.

## What have people said about Rob and SKILSTAK?

There's no better marketing than word of mouth. In fact, since 2013 we've *never* needed to advertise. The first two community members were referrals from friends who were in tech and knew their kids needed to learn it. Since then, SKILSTAK has helped thousands to accomplish their learning and career goals.

Here's how one company representative described it in an email after hiring a community member with a 100,000 dollar starting salary:

> Clearly, you have a talent for educating people in tech. ... After [your member's] success [here], I suspect the review team will be even more interested in picking up one or two of your students. We've had a lot of very bright interns from some of the top universities in the country and [your community member] was right in the mix with the best of them.

Rob met this person at a Linux meetup and introduced them to our community members.

!!! tip "How to get a job?"

    We talk about this a lot in the Boost. Getting hired is about building trust with potential employers by producing demonstratable, unique proof that you can produce what that company needs. We help people do it all the time.

Since SKILSTAK is largely a labor of love we maintain a [collection of nice things people have said over the years](about/nice.md).

!!! tip "Want to add your own nice comment?"
    We love when people are helped. Feel free to mention it in the Discord or message [rwxrob](https://linktr.ee/rwxrob) directly. Or, just add your own to the comments by making a PR.

## Why no Slack channel?

We don't have a Slack channel because we already have Discord. It is annoying that many companies block access to Discord. Consider accessing from your personal phone (preferably with speech-to-text) while at work if you face that kind of annoyance.
