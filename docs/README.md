# Welcome!

Welcome to the **SKILSTAK Learning Community**!

You've reached our knowledge base and home of the annual, crowd-sourced Beginner Boost learning event. This is where we document everything in a searchable, mobile-friendly way to supplement our YouTube video content, live Twitch sessions, and Discord channel discussions. Master, beginner, or just lurker, we do hope you'll join us as we blow the doors off broken traditional education paradigms.

## How can I see the latest changes?

This content is ever changing and evolving as improvements are made and changes in technology occur. To keep up with exactly what has changed, refer to the GitHub link in the top right (and give us a star, if you don't mind).

## Why no Slack channel?

Because we already have Discord. It is annoying that many companies block access to Discord. Consider accessing from your personal phone (preferably with speech-to-text) while at work if you face that kind of annoyance.
