# Planning notes

## Sunday, February 25, 2024, 12:30:47PM EST

* No calendar, just regular time
* 20 min homework review + 3x40 with 6 minute breaks + 20 min homework assign + 2 min raid
* Focus on habitual streaming times (pm, sunsets, etc.)
* Consistent time for Beginner Boost (only): Sundays, noon-3pm
* Multi-stream to Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and Kick
* Need to get scene switcher board (probably StreamDeck)?
* Start Restream to YouTube and hit "Record" at beginning of each block, then upload to YouTube
* It's actually easier to livestream raw content
* "Make use of mods" for titles and user management
* Still never going to have chat on the screen
* Only taking questions during the break
* Dedicated to Kris Nova
* Send people away with weekly "homework"
* Should we have a community-driven/maintained wiki?
* Always repeat the content of the chat before responding
* Prioritize good audio media (what if this is podcast only)

Action items:

* Update `!boost` command (and all commands)
